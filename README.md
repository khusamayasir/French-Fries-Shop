# Fries-Shop
This is the lab project of ‘Data Structure and Algorithms’ from third semester.
I have designed the code of “French Fries Shop” featuring queue, stack, and sorting implementation with my team.
This project contains 4 Different Forms.
“C# Programming language” is used to write this code and the code compiler is “Visual Studio Community 2019”.

This project contains some interesting features which are as follows. There are three buttons:
• Main Menu
