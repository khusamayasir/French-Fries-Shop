# Fries-Shop
This is the lab project of ‘Data Structure and Algorithms’ from third semester.
I have designed the code of “French Fries Shop” featuring queue, stack, and sorting implementation with my team.
This project contains 4 Different Forms.
“C# Programming language” is used to write this code and the code compiler is “Visual Studio Community 2019”.
